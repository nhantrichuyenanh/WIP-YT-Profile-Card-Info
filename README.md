>[!NOTE]
> Since add-on has to get data from clicking YouTube comments' profiles, it's unfeasible to use.

- Step 1: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → Temporary Extensions (0): Load Temporary Add-on... → select file → Open
- Step 2: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com) → select a video to watch → scroll down to the comment section
- Step 3: while add-on is doing its stuff, don't click anything and the more you scroll the more stuff it has to do
